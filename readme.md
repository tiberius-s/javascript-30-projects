# JavaScript 30 Projects

### Recently came across the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course, and it looks like it contains a lot of exercises with which I can stay sharp. Even better, these challenges are all in plain JS, so it's nice to work through these without the crutch of a framework of library.
